# KaruScripting

Project reads JSON files. The script can be found in the Output/ folder.

Important: Logo frames have not been uploaded because of the amount of frames (310 frames + file.import = 620 files to upload...)
Also it's pretty much unnecessary the amount of frames so I'll try to cut out plenty of them to reduce the game size.

As said on the discord, what's being done so far:

Main Menu scene with the logo animation, buttons and background.

Dialogue loading in different files if needed. I've tested loading a script from other and running it at the end of the first one.
Smoothly works. This might be helpful to applicate effects like transitions, to organize events/cinematics and so.

JSON Reads the following: Character (or anonymous), illustrations, dialogues. Detects if a task has been done. Loads choices from scratch. Loads effects.

What's remaining:

Having an actual script to work with.

Making tasks/minigames if requested.

Aesthetic settings, the following Hover texture on cursor. Supporting different resolutions and resizing them. Add Music and Volume settings.
